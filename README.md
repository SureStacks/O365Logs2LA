# O365Logs2LA

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FSureStacks2FO365Logs2LA%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)



Send Office 365 unified logs to log analytics with .Net and Managed Identities and optimize resources and security.

There are already available samples and connectors to send Office 365 Unifed Logs to Log Analytics/Sentinel:

 * [Sentinel DataConnector for O365](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data/readme.md)

 * [Sample AIP Audit Export](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/blob/master/AIP-Audit-Export/Export-AIPAuditLogOperations.ps1) 
 
Both are based on PowerShell and will use Shared Key. 

This project has two objectives:

* Optimise resource usage by using a compiled language (.net)
* Leverage modern authentication with Managed Identities and avoid Shared Key

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that you'll unified audit logs enabled on your tenant to retrieve those.

## High-level Overview

The function app will register a subscription to Office 365 Management API and be notified of log presence via a webhook.


```ascii  
                      | Key Vault (Secret)     |           
                      | - Log Analytics        |<- - - - - - - - +
                      |   Workspace Shared Key |                 
                      +------------------------+                 |
                                  ^
                                  | App Setting                  | 
                                  |
-----+                 +----------------------+                +-----

                         üîë Managed Identity
```

The permissions needed for the managed identity are:

 * Office 365 Management APIs
   * ActivityFeed.Read
   * *ActivityFeed.ReadDLP* (if DLP.All is needed)
 * Log Analytics Workspace
   * Access the secret in the "Key Vault" holding the shared key

## Other tools and Cost considerations

There are already multiple solutions to have those Office 365 logs and Alerts.

If you are looking for Alerts many of the underlying tools have already some alerting possibilities like Azure Information Protection. Neverthe less having a those logs in log analytics will provide a more focused view and allow Alarm to be tied to a more refined query (i.e. Alerts may be limited to updated sensitivy lable where a query will allow spotting sensitibitiy label downgrade).

Having the logs can already be enabled via other tools and samples from Microsoft (mentioned earlier):
 * [Sentinel DataConnector for O365](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/DataConnectors/O365%20Data/readme.md)
 * [Sample AIP Audit Export](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-Information-Protection-Samples/blob/master/AIP-Audit-Export/Export-AIPAuditLogOperations.ps1) 
Both are based on PowerShell and execute on a schedule. 

A rapid comparison of the different solutions:

| **Solution** | **Platform** | **Schedule** | **Logs Supported** | **Price Consideration** |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- |  --- |  
 Sentinel Connector| N/A | N/A | Audit.AzureActiveDirectory, Audit.SharePoint, Audit.Exchange | Ingested Logs (GB/day - reductions for E5 customers) + Retention |
 Sentinel DataConnector for O365 | PowerShell | Every 5 minutes | All | Ingested Logs (GB/day - first 5GB/month free) + Retention |
 | Sample AIP Audit Export | PowerShell | Every 5 minutes | AIP Audit | Ingested Logs (GB/day - first 5GB/month free) + Retention |
 | O365Logs2LA | .net core | WebHook | All | Ingested Logs (GB/day - first 5GB/month free) + Retention |

 For more information on logs exposed by Office 365 Management API that are used by Sentinel connectors and thise project:

| **Log Type** | **Descroption** |
| --- | --- |
| Audit.AzureActiveDirectory | Azure Active Directory logs that‚Äôs relates to Office 365 only |
| Audit.Exchange | User and Admin Activities in Exchange Online |
| Audit.SharePoint | User and Admin Activities in SharePoint Online |
| Audit.General | Includes all other workloads not included in the previous content types	|
| DLP.All | DLP events only for all workloads |


## Granting Permissions to Office 365 Management APIs via PowerShell

```PowerShell
# Install the required module
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force -AllowClobber
Install-Module -Name MSAL.PS, Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -Force

# Connect to Azure AD
$TenantID = "<Your Tenant ID>"
Connect-MgGraph -TenantId $TenantID -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All", "DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All"

# Get the service principal for the managed identity
$ManagedIdentityId = "<Your Managed Identity ID>"
$ServicePrincipal = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "id eq '$ManagedIdentityId'"

# Get the service principal for the Office 365 Management APIs
$Office365APIId = "c5393580-f805-4401-95e8-94b7a6ef2fc2" # This is the standard Application ID for the Office 365 Management APIs
$Office365API = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$Office365APIId'"

# Get the specific permissions from the Office 365 Management APIs service principal
$Permissions = $Office365API.AppRoles | Where-Object { $_.Value -in ('ActivityFeed.Read','ActivityFeed.ReadDlp') }

# Assign the permissions to the managed identity
$Permissions | ForEach-Object {
     New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment -ServicePrincipalId $ServicePrincipal.Id -AppRoleId $_.Id -PrincipalId $ServicePrincipal.Id -ResourceId $Office365API.Id
}
```

## Sample query to list Sensitivity Label downgrades

This query will require to receive the following content types:
* Audit.General
* Audit.SharePoint

They should cover modifications made in Office desktop, SharePoint and OneDrive (Office on the web).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This has currenty been tested with OneDrive and Word desktop.

```KQL
Audit_SharePoint_CL 
| where SensitivityLabelEventData_LabelEventType_d == 2 
| project TimeGenerated, Workload=Workload_s, Application=AppAccessContext_ClientAppName_s, ClientIP=ClientIP_s, FileID=ObjectId_s, OldLabel=SensitivityLabelEventData_OldSensitivityLabelId_g, NewLabel=SensitivityLabelEventData_SensitivityLabelId_g, Justification=SensitivityLabelJustificationText_s
| union (
    Audit_General_CL
    | where SensitivityLabelEventData_LabelEventType_d == 2
    | project TimeGenerated, Workload=Workload_s, Application=Application_s, ClientIP=ClientIP_s, FileID=ObjectId_s, OldLabel = SensitivityLabelEventData_OldSensitivityLabelId_g, NewLabel = SensitivityLabelEventData_SensitivityLabelId_g, Justification=SensitivityLabelEventData_JustificationText_s
)
```
